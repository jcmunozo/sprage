Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up your free MongoDB Atlas database:

### Step 1: Create a MongoDB Atlas Account

1.  Go to the MongoDB Atlas website: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2.  Fill out the registration form to create a new account. You can also sign up with your Google account if you prefer.

### Step 2: Create a Free Cluster

1.  After you create your account and log in, you will be prompted to create a new cluster. Choose the "M0" (Free) cluster option.
2.  You can keep the default settings for the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) and the region.
3.  Give your cluster a name (e.g., "LanguageCardsCluster") or just keep the default name.
4.  Click the "Create Cluster" button. It will take a few minutes for your cluster to be created.

### Step 3: Create a Database User

1.  While your cluster is being created, you'll need to create a database user. This is not the same as your Atlas account user. This user will have access to the database itself.
2.  In the left-hand menu, go to "Database Access".
3.  Click the "Add New Database User" button.
4.  Enter a username and a password.
    *   Important: Remember this username and password. You will need them for the connection string later. I recommend using a strong, unique password.
5.  For "Database User Privileges", you can select "Read and write to any database" for now.
6.  Click "Add User".

### Step 4: Configure Network Access

1.  Next, you need to allow your computer to connect to the database.
2.  In the left-hand menu, go to "Network Access".
3.  Click the "Add IP Address" button.
4.  A dialog will pop up. Click the "Add Current IP Address" button. This will automatically add your computer's current IP address to the access list.
5.  Click "Confirm".

### Step 5: Get the Connection String

1.  Now that your cluster is ready, you need to get the "connection string". This is a unique address for your database that our application will use to connect to it.
2.  In the left-hand menu, go to "Database".
3.  You should see your cluster. Click the "Connect" button.
4.  A dialog will pop up. Select the "Drivers" option (it might be labeled "Connect your application").
5.  You will see a connection string. It will look something like this:
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
6.  Copy this connection string and save it somewhere safe. This is the key to your database.

Once you have the connection string, please let me know, and we can move on to the next step: building the backend to connect to your new database! Do not share the connection string with me, just let me know that you have it.
